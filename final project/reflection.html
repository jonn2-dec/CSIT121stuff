        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

        <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
        <p>
I revistied all my labs to see the things i learned, it really showecased how far i've come along. I combined my knowledge and from professor noone example, they were actually so helpful. They saved me lot of times.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest challenge overall is understanding how to make it work in github. The thing with github is sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't. After learning what was wrong i realized some of them are because of small mistakes.

        <h3>Testing on Multiple Browsers &amp; Devices</h3>
        <p>
            The site was tested in at least two desktop browsers and on a mobile device to check layout,
            typography, and navigation behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing confirmed that the media query correctly adjusted the layout for smaller screens and
            helped reveal small spacing issues that were not obvious on desktop.
        </p>

        <h3>Course‑Wide Takeaways</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout CSIT 121, there was a strong emphasis on writing clean, valid HTML and CSS and understanding
            how browsers interpret that code.
        </p>

I really liked csit 121, it felt long yet fast. Thanks professor noone for teaching me everything.
