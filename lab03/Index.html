            <h2>What the Protest is About</h2>
            <p>
                Although most people know this as protest about social media ban,
                it really is not about social media ban.
                This has been an ongoing issue where the rich kids
                live luxuriously while the poor struggle to make a living.

                Reflection 1 (Lab 02): What I learned from lab 02 is how important it is to make sure the 
                <span class="highlight">tags are correct</span> despite it might not show on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other things I learned are about <span class="highlight">links</span> and the tag for that is href!
            </p>
            <p id="special">This is my example of id selector and I decided to pick blue because why not.</p>
            <p>
                I would say, though, one of my favorite things about this would be the color for my background. And thanks for giving us color to choose from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflection 2 (Lab 03): Since lab02, I learned more about organizing folders, creating external stylesheets, and making my code easier to maintain. I also paid attention to using correct tags and clear color choices.
